Welcome to CommaCombine

CommaCombine will allow you to quickly combine multiple comma separated files into a single file. There is also the option to remove the first row (which usually contains the headings) from every subsequent file.

*June 11 2012
	You can now select and add multiple files at once.

*April 10 2012
	Added the functionality to sort the data by a user specified column before exporting (along with the option to remove the first row from being included in the sort).

Enjoy!
